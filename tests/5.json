The action can be an Amazon EC2 action, an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling action, or a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic. You can also add alarms to CloudWatch dashboards and monitor them visually. When an alarm is on a dashboard, it turns red when it is in the ALARM state, making it easier for you to monitor its status proactively.<br> You can publish your own metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API. You can view statistical graphs of your published metrics with the AWS Management Console.<br> Option B is invalid since this is used for logging purposes and here you need to view the metrics<br> Option C is invalid since this is used for API monitoring purposes<br> Option D is invalid since here we have to assume that we need to monitor metrics for an application and hence you would need to publish custom metrics<br> For more information on publishing custom metrics and alarms, please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html</a><br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html</a><br> The correct answer is: Publish custom metrics for the application that can be monitored via Cloudwatch.

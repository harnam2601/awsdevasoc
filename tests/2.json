For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET requests per second per prefix in a bucket. There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. It is simple to increase your read or write performance exponentially. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second.<br> For more details, please check below AWS Docs:<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html</a><br> The correct answer is: exampleawsbucket/232a-2019-14-03-15-00-00/photo1.jpg",

A multi-AZ DAX cluster can serve millions of requests per second.<br> DAX is ideal for:<br> Applications that require the fastest possible response time for reads. Some examples include real-time bidding, social gaming, and trading applications. DAX delivers fast, in-memory read performance for these use cases.<br> Applications that read a small number of items more frequently than others. For example, consider an e-commerce system that has a one-day sale on a popular product. During the sale, demand for that product (and its data in DynamoDB) would sharply increase, compared to all of the other products. To mitigate the impacts of a “hot” key and a non-uniform data distribution, you could offload the read activity to a DAX cache until the one-day sale is over.<br> Applications that are read-intensive, but are also cost-sensitive. With DynamoDB, you provision the number of reads per second that your application requires. If read activity increases, you can increase your tables’ provisioned read throughput (at an additional cost).

        "The AWS Documentation mentions the following<br> Proposed solution: an in-memory cache based on Amazon ElastiCache<br> Because the issue involves latency to the backend database, we propose an in-memory cache based on Amazon ElastiCache to reduce network latency and to offload the database pressure. This solution dramatically reduces the data retrieval latency. It also scales request volume considerably, because Amazon ElastiCache can deliver extremely high request rates, measured at over 20 million per second. The following diagram shows the proposed architecture.<br> Option A is incorrect since normally cloudfront distribution are placed in front of the front tier of the application<br> Option B is incorrect since this is used for fault tolerant scenarios for the database<br> Option C is incorrect since this is used for queuing of messages<br> For more information on reducing latency’s for hybrid architectures , please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/latency-reduction-of-hybrid-architectures-with-amazon-elasticache/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/latency-reduction-of-hybrid-architectures-with-amazon-elasticache/</a><br> The correct answer is: Place an ElastiCache in front of the database",

It includes secure default behaviour for developers who are not encryption experts, while being flexible enough to work for the most experienced users.<br> Options A and C are incorrect because you should never use the Customer master keys directly for the encryption of decryption process.<br> In the AWS Encryption SDK, by default, you generate a new data key for each encryption operation<br> For more information on the Encryption SDK , please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-top.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-top.html</a><br> Note:<br> AWS Docs Says<br> “When you encrypt your data, your data is protected, but you have to protect your encryption key. One strategy is to encrypt it. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data with a data key, and then encrypting the data key under another key.<br> You can even encrypt the data encryption key under another encryption key, and encrypt that encryption key another encryption key. But, eventually, one key must remain in plaintext so you can decrypt the keys and your data. This top-level plaintext key encryption key is known as the master key.”<br> For more information on the enveloping, please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping</a><br> The correct answers are: Use the Customer master key to generate a data key for the encryption process, Use the generated data key to decrypt the data",

Git credentials are the easiest method for users of your repository to set up and use. SSH connections require your users to generate a public-private key pair, store the public key, associate the public key with their IAM user, configure their known hosts file on their local computer, and create and maintain a config file on their local computers. Because this is a more complex configuration process, we recommend you choose HTTPS and Git credentials for connections to AWS CodeCommit.<br> The easiest way to set up AWS CodeCommit is to configure HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit.

For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET requests per second per prefix in a bucket. There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. It is simple to increase your read or write performance exponentially. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second.</p> <p>For more details, please check below AWS Docs:<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html</a></p> </div> </div> <input type=\"button\" name=\"back\" value=\"Back\" class=\"wpProQuiz_button wpProQuiz_QuestionButton\" style=\"float: left !important; margin-right: 10px !important; display: none;\"> <input type=\"button\" name=\"check\" value=\"Check\" class=\"wpProQuiz_button wpProQuiz_QuestionButton\" style=\"float: right !important; margin-right: 10px !important; display: none;\"> <input type=\"button\" name=\"unselect\" id=\"unselect\" value=\"Clear Answer\" class=\"wpProQuiz_button wpProQuiz_QuestionButton\" style=\"float: left; display: none;\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"quizid\" id=\"quizid\" value=\"UnSelect\" class=\"wpProQuiz_button wpProQuiz_QuestionButton\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 40%; display: none;\"> <input type=\"button\" name=\"next\" value=\"Next\" class=\"wpProQuiz_button wpProQuiz_QuestionButton\" style=\"float: right; display: none;\"> ",

        "Answer – C<br> This is mentioned in the AWS Documentation<br> Adding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to a User Pool<br> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) increases security for your app by adding another authentication method, and not relying solely on user name and password. You can choose to use SMS text messages, or time-based one-time (TOTP) passwords as second factors in signing in your users.<br> With adaptive authentication, you can configure your user pool to require second factor authentication in response to an increased risk level. To add adaptive authentication to your user pool, see Adding Advanced Security to a User Pool.<br> Options A and B are incorrect since it’s not the right approach to use IAM users or groups for access for mobile based applications<br> Option D is incorrect since SAML is used for federated access.<br> For more information on Cognito with MFA , please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html</a>",

        "Create multiple environments and deploy the different versions to different environments",
        "Create an application lifecycle policy",
        "Create multiple applications and deploy the different versions to different applications",
        "Delete the application versions manually",

        "Answer – B<br> The AWS Documentation mentions the following<br> Each time you upload a new version of your application with the Elastic Beanstalk console or the EB CLI, Elastic Beanstalk creates an&nbsp;application version. If you don’t delete versions that you no longer use, you will eventually reach the&nbsp;application version limit&nbsp;and be unable to create new versions of that application.<br> You can avoid hitting the limit by applying an&nbsp;application version lifecycle policy&nbsp;to your applications. A lifecycle policy tells Elastic Beanstalk to delete application versions that are old, or to delete application versions when the total number of versions for an application exceeds a specified number.<br> Options A and C are invalid because these are not the right approaches when managing deployment of application versions.<br> Option D even though possible , is not the most effective way.<br> For more information on application lifecycle , please refer to the below URL<br> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/applications-lifecycle.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/applications-lifecycle.html</a>",
